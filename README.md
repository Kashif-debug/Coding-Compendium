Hey everyone, this repository contains all my code I've completed during the "Coding Compendium", which is a coding bootcamp. 

This bootcamp contains these five sections (further details on each section can be found on the README's in each respective section once they have been pushed):

I) Web Development Foundations: Learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
II) Advanced Javascript Concepts
III) React Mastery and Global State Management
IV) Integrating Database: Learning how to use mongodb and firebase
V) My Personal Project: Forming a Personal Project that is bringing all these concepts together


* At the moment, I have completed the first section of said bootcamp. I will periodically be pushing corresponding projects for each section until I've completed the bootcamp.
