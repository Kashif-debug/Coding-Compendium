The purpose of this README is to list all the projects in this level and the corresponding covered concept of each.

This section is focused on learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Ultimately, there are a range of simple mini-projects each reinforcing various concepts at a surface level, as elaborated in this README file.
