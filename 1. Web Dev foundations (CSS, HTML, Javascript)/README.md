The purpose of this README is to list all the projects in this level, the technologies used, and the corresponding covered concept of each project.  


* Note: Each project has a README file within it fully explaining functionalities.  


This section is focused on learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Ultimately, there are a range of simple mini-projects each reinforcing various concepts at a surface level, as elaborated in this README file.  


* Note: Each project may slowly be building off of concepts covered in previous projects (especially ones that are later on, that also happen to be covering the same topic of either HTML, CSS, and Javascript).
